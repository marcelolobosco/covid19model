Datasets are used as initial conditions for simulations and/or for validating numerical results. All of them were obtained in the literature (see the list below). The file name (Viral_load_10_2.csv) describes the dataset (for example, Viral_load), the number of the paper were data were obtained (for example, _10) and the figure/table were it appers (for example, _2).
